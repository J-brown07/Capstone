	   <centre>N'it. Bee Grandison-hl way'. Ksim Nisga'a n'iiy' ii Gitlaxt'aamiks wil w'itgwiy'. Hello. My name is Bee Grandison. I am Nisga'a from Gitlaxt'aamiks in North-Western B.C. I provide individual, couples, family & crisis counselling. I utilize a client-centred, strengths-based approach in the work I do with clients. Having worked through my own trauma, severe anxiety/depression, I understand that healing & good mental health is a life-long journey. I have a certificate in Substance Use as well as Indigenous Focussing Oriented therapy & Complex Trauma. I am in the process of obtaining my Masters Degree in Counselling with City University. As we say in the Nisga'a language: Dax gat'inhl Goodin dim ii amaa didils n'iin. Translation: Strengthen your mind/heart and you will live a Good life. I believe in a holistic approach to healing the mind, body and spirit. Therefore, getting fresh air, exercise, eating healthy and connecting with family, friends and community all contribute to good mental health.</p>
